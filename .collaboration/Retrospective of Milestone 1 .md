## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?
- Divergence stage and proposing different ideas to research further. 
### What parts of your plan did not work out?
- Convergence stage, we kind of got lost in how to asses our ideas and choose.
### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
