# Retrospective

Throughout the data collection phase of our project, we encountered significant challenges in locating relevant datasets. Our initial approach was slow and often felt like searching for a needle in a haystack. Despite these hurdles, our perseverance paid off when we finally identified the dataset that perfectly met our project requirements. This journey taught us valuable lessons about research, teamwork, and the importance of adaptability.

## Stop Doing
* We realized that our research methods were not as effective as we had hoped. Relying heavily on broad internet searches often led us down rabbit holes with little relevance to our project goals. Moving forward, we plan to reduce our dependence on such unfocused strategies.

* As we reflect on our initial approach to data collection, we recognize the need for a more focused and efficient strategy moving forward. To address this, we've outlined several key changes to our research methodology:

**Defining Specific Criteria for Information Relevance:** Before we even start our next search, we will establish clear criteria that define what makes information relevant to our project objectives. This means setting specific parameters that data must meet to be considered useful for our analysis. By doing this, we aim to streamline our search process, ensuring that every piece of data we collect directly contributes to our project goals.

**Utilizing Specialized Databases or Resources:** We've learned that general internet searches can be too broad and time-consuming, often leading us to irrelevant information. To improve our efficiency, we plan to tap into specialized databases and resources that are more aligned with our project's theme. These platforms are likely to offer higher-quality data that are more pertinent to our research, saving us time and enhancing the depth of our analysis.

* Last but not least, We also recognized that our progress was hampered by procrastination and a tendency to delay decisions in the hope of finding perfect solutions. This often left us running in circles rather than moving forward.


## Continue Doing

* One of our strengths was our persistence. Despite the challenges, we never gave up on our search for the right dataset. This resilience is something we are proud of and will continue to embrace in all project phases.

* Our ability to come together and brainstorm solutions when faced with obstacles was invaluable. This collaborative spirit helped us navigate through tough times and ultimately led to our success in finding the dataset.
  
* weekly check-in meetings to discuss progress, address any challenges, and realign our goals as necessary. These meetings will ensure that everyone is on the same page and that any issues are quickly identified and resolved.

## Start Doing


Adopting Agile Methodologies: Recognizing the value of flexibility and iterative progress, we're incorporating agile practices into our project management approach. This will involve breaking down our project into smaller, manageable tasks and evaluating our progress in regular sprints, allowing us to adapt and refine our strategies as we go.


Setting Clear Goals and Deadlines: We understand the importance of clear objectives and realistic deadlines. To this end, we're establishing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for each phase of our project, which will guide our efforts and help us stay on track.

Fostering a Positive Team Environment: We're dedicated to creating a supportive and inclusive team atmosphere. This involves recognizing each member's contributions, encouraging open discussion of ideas and feedback, and supporting each other's professional growth and well-being.

Utilizing Project Management Tools: To better organize our tasks and timelines, we're utilizing project management tools like Trello or Asana. These platforms will help us visualize our project's progress, assign tasks, and set deadlines more effectively.

## Lessons Learned
The journey taught us the critical importance of having a focused research strategy. A more organized and targeted approach to data collection can significantly reduce time wasted on irrelevant information.

We learned that team adaptability and resilience are crucial in overcoming research challenges. Our experience has shown us that being flexible and willing to adjust our strategies when needed can lead to project milestones being achieved more effectively.

Finally, we discovered that early challenges could catalyze greater team cohesion and success. Overcoming these initial obstacles together has not only strengthened our team dynamics but also improved our collective problem-solving skills.

This reflection captures our team's journey through the data collection phase, highlighting both the challenges we faced and the valuable lessons we learned. As we move forward, we are committed to applying these insights to enhance our project's success and our effectiveness as a team.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?
* In the data collection phase of our project, we successfully implemented a structured approach to identify and secure the relevant datasets we needed. Our efforts to define specific criteria for information relevance before beginning the search proved effective, as it guided us toward the right sources more efficiently. The decision to utilize specialized databases and professional networks also went as planned, providing us with high-quality data relevant to our project objectives.
  
### What parts of your plan did not work out?
* However, our initial timeline for completing the data collection phase was overly optimistic. We underestimated the time required to locate the appropriate datasets, mostly due to the challenges in navigating specialized databases and securing access to certain data sources. This resulted in delays that pushed back our project timeline.
