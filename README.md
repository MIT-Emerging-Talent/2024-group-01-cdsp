# :seedling: Urbanization & Agriculture: Effects And Mitigation Strategies

## :earth_africa: Overview

The rapid pace of Urbanization in recent years poses significant challenges to the agricultural sector, impacting its productivity, sustainability, and ability to meet the rising food demands of urban populations. As cities expand and take over farmland, agricultural activities face many adverse effects, including limited land availability, soil degradation, reduced water resources, and changing market dynamics. These factors collectively threaten the viability and long-term sustainability of the agricultural sector. 
Although Urbanization may seem to have only negative impacts on agriculture, it can also lead to improved infrastructure, such as roads and transportation networks, which can benefit agriculture by reducing the cost and time required to transport agricultural products to markets.
Therefore, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted consequences of Urbanization on agriculture for devising sustainable strategies that ensure food security while mitigating adverse effects on rural livelihoods and environmental sustainability.

## :microscope: Actionable Research Questions

We aim to investigate the impacts of Urbanization on agricultural productivity and sustainability and the strategies that can be implemented to mitigate adverse effects and harness potential benefits.

## System and Design Thinking
Environment, ecology, and societies make a perfect example of what complex systems are. their intertwined relationships, interdependence, mutual effects, and life cycles; are all characteristics of such systems.
In addressing our selected issue we will be relying on and adopting a system thinking mindset, investigating the different phenomenons of these connections, their correlations and causalities, and their feedback loops in action through time.
As our research question involves human factors when addressing urbanization, it's also imperative to center humans in the middle of the process, therefore we are adaption concepts from the design thinking framework to relate and empathize with the communities we are analyzing, and include them throughout defining the issues and drivers related to urbanization and agriculture, also to ideate and prototype our study until we get to test our hypothesis with real data from the field.
